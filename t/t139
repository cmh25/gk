/ this generates a stack error and doesn't print anything else out.
/ however, it uncovered a couple of bugs:
/ 1. valence was previously determined by number of variables in scope,
/    which got incremented to 2 the first time this was called due to
/    the t variable. so first call was valence 1, subsequent calls were valence 2.
/ 2. memory handling was all messed between fne_(), avdo(), and scanm7().
